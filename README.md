##########Facts Found
1.Leader Strength Metric:

A unique metric we introduced, called leader strength (followers / (1 + following)), shows that users with a higher follower-to-following ratio tend to have better "influence" in terms of followers. Our analysis of the top 5 users by leader strength could indicate users who have a strong influence relative to their level of engagement with others.
Hireable Usersâ€™ Following Behavior:

2.On average, hireable users follow more people than non-hireable users. This could reflect a networking-oriented behavior, where hireable individuals actively engage with a wider audience or maintain a higher number of connections.
Programming Language Diversity in Repositories:

3.We observed a wide variety of programming languages across repositories, with some languages showing higher follower counts. This diversity highlights the range of expertise and potential collaboration opportunities within different language communities on GitHub.
Repository Features and Licensing:

A significant number of repositories have wikis and projects enabled, showing a trend toward more documentation and project management.
